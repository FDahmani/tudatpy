        The model is based on Lainey et al. (2007, 2012). It can compute the acceleration due to tides, and in
        particular tidal dissipation, on a planetary satellite. The acceleration computed can account for either the

        The acceleration model is purpose-built to represent short bursts of thrust, such as a momentum wheel desaturation.
        A typical use case is precise orbit determination, but the functionality can be used just as well in propagation
        (for instance to model an impulsive manuever in a continuous manner when going from preliminary modelling to
        'full' modelling). The thrust is modelled similarly to Fig. 3 of Alessi et al. (2012), with the main difference
        being that a third-order polynomial to go from zero acceleration to the maximum acceleration level is employed.
        By using a 3rd-order polynomial and imposing continuity in the value and first derivative of the acceleration,
        defining the 'rise time' (time it takes acceleration to go from 0 to its maximum level), the total time where
        there is non-zero thrust ('total maneuver time'), and the total Delta V exerted by a single maneuver,
